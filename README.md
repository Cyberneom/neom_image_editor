# neom_media_upload
neom_image_editor is a specialized module within the Open Neom ecosystem dedicated to providing
robust image editing functionalities. In its initial release, it focuses on essential image cropping capabilities,
allowing users to precisely adjust the dimensions and aspect ratio of their images.

This module is designed to enhance the visual quality of user-generated content
and ensure images fit various display requirements across the platform.

While currently focused on cropping, neom_image_editor is built with a forward-looking architecture,
ready for future expansion to include a wider array of image manipulation tools, filters, 
and advanced editing features. It adheres to Open Neom's Clean Architecture principles, 
ensuring it is highly testable, maintainable, and seamlessly integrates with neom_core 
for core services and neom_commons for shared UI components. This module contributes to 
the Tecnozenism vision by empowering users with tools for conscious digital expression.

üåü Features & Responsibilities

In its current version (v1.0.0), neom_image_editor primarily offers:
‚Ä¢	Image Cropping: Provides a user-friendly interface to crop images to specific aspect ratios 
    (e.g., square, 3x2, 4x3, 16x9, original) or custom dimensions.
‚Ä¢	Platform-Optimized UI: Presents a native-like cropping experience with customizable UI settings
    for both Android and iOS, ensuring a consistent and intuitive user interaction.
‚Ä¢	Integration with Media Pipeline: Designed to receive image files from media selection modules
    (like neom_media_upload) and return processed images for further use (e.g., uploading, displaying in neom_posts).

Future Expansion (Roadmap)
neom_image_editor is envisioned to grow significantly, with plans to incorporate:
‚Ä¢	Advanced Image Editing: Tools for brightness, contrast, saturation, and other fundamental adjustments.
‚Ä¢	Filters and Effects: A library of pre-defined filters and artistic effects to enhance image aesthetics.
‚Ä¢	Text and Sticker Overlays: Functionality to add text, stickers, and other graphic elements to images.
‚Ä¢	Drawing Tools: Basic drawing and annotation capabilities directly on images.
‚Ä¢	Integration with AI-powered Enhancements: Leveraging AI for smart enhancements,
    background removal, or other advanced image manipulations.

üì¶ Technical Highlights / Why it Matters (for developers)
For developers, neom_image_editor serves as an excellent case study for:
‚Ä¢	Specialized Feature Module Development: Demonstrates how to create a highly focused 
    module for a specific, complex functionality (image editing).
‚Ä¢	External Package Integration: Showcases effective integration of image_cropper, a powerful 
    third-party library, and how to wrap its functionalities within a Clean Architecture service.
‚Ä¢	Service-Oriented Architecture: Implements the ImageEditorService interface, illustrating how image
    editing logic is decoupled and consumed by other modules (e.g., neom_media_upload, neom_posts)
    without direct knowledge of its implementation details.
‚Ä¢	Platform-Specific UI Customization: Provides examples of configuring platform-specific UI settings
    for external packages to match the application's theme and user experience.
‚Ä¢	Future-Proof Design: Its current minimal functionality coupled with the ImageEditorService
    interface exemplifies how a module can be designed to easily accommodate significant
    future expansions without requiring changes in its consumers.

How it Supports the Open Neom Initiative
neom_image_editor is vital to the Open Neom ecosystem and the broader Tecnozenism vision by:
‚Ä¢	Enhancing Content Quality: By providing tools for image optimization, it helps users create visually
    appealing content, enriching the overall platform experience.
‚Ä¢	Empowering Digital Expression: It gives users more control over their visual narratives,
    aligning with the Tecnozenism principle of conscious and creative interaction with technology.
‚Ä¢	Facilitating Research Visuals: Researchers can use precise cropping to prepare images for data
    visualization or presentations, ensuring clarity and focus.
‚Ä¢	Showcasing Modularity: As a self-contained module, it exemplifies Open Neom's "Plug-and-Play" architecture,
    demonstrating how complex functionalities can be built independently and integrated seamlessly.

üöÄ Usage
This module provides the ImageEditorService interface and its implementation (ImageEditorController).
Other modules (e.g., neom_media_upload after image selection, neom_posts for inline editing) 
inject and utilize ImageEditorService to perform image cropping operations.

üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies
neom_image_editor relies on neom_core for core services and neom_commons for reusable UI
components and utilities. It directly depends on image_cropper for its core functionality.
